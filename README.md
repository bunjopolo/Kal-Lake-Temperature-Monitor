# Kal-Lake-Temperature-Monitor

This web app displays the temperature of Kalamalka Lake in Coldstream BC, Canada. 
As far as I know this is the only publically available data on the lake's temperature. 

Data is recorded with a Particle Boron cellular development board every 12 hours and transmited to the database.
The sensor used is a Maxim Integrated DS18B20 1-wire programmable digital thermometer and is accurate to +-0.5 degrees celsius. 

The web app is live at https://www.kallaketemperature.xyz/
